### 🧠 Problem Statement

The goal was to analyze product sales and profitability across different categories and months. Key questions addressed:

- What categories drive the most profit vs sales?
- Are we losing money on high-selling products?
- How do monthly sales and profits trend across the year?
- Are there periods where sales don’t translate to profit?
- How efficient is the business overall?

---

### 🔑 KPI Highlights

- **Total Sales**: ₦2,297,201  
- **Total Profit**: ₦286,397  
- **Profit Ratio**: 12.5%

➡️ While revenue is strong, the low profit ratio suggests operational inefficiencies or discount-heavy strategies.

---

### 📂 Sub-Category Analysis

- ✅ **Top performers**: Phones & Accessories (strong sales + profit)
- ⚠️ **Average**: Chairs, Binders (good sales, lower profits)
- 🔻 **Concerns**: Tables, Bookcases (sales with low/negative profit)

---

### 📅 Trends Over Time

- 📈 **Sales** peak in November & December (holiday boost)
- 💰 **Profit** dips in July & September
- 📉 **Profit Ratio** lowest in July (under 8%)

---

### ✅ Recommendations

1. Promote **Phones & Accessories** during peak periods.
2. Optimize or discontinue **loss leaders** like Tables.
3. Prepare for **Q4 promotions** to maximize profits.
4. Track **profit ratio**, not just raw sales.
5. Investigate July for cost control opportunities.

### 📌 What I Learned

- Telling stories through data matters.
- Dashboards must go beyond visuals—they should answer questions.
- Tableau can be powerful for identifying trends and driving strategy.
